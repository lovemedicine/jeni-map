        The Justice Equity Need Index (JENI) identifies ZIP Codes in greatest
        need of public investments in community healing, health, and prevention
        to help reverse historical injustices.
      </p>

      <p>
        JENI offers a means to map out the disparate burden that criminalization
        and a detention-first justice model place on specific communities. The
        index includes the following indicators:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>System Involvement</strong>: The system-involved population by
          ZIP Code results in direct needs for justice equity, as measured by
          adult and youth probation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inequity Drivers</strong>: Root inequities across communities
          that contribute to racial and economic disparities as seen in
          incarceration and policing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Criminalization Risk</strong>: Conditions where the criminal
          justice system has historically taken a detention-first,
          prevention-last approach.
        </li>
      </ul>
